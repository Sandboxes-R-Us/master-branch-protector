Adapted from [github-developer/using-the-github-api-in-your-app](https://github.com/github-developer/using-the-github-api-in-your-app).

This is an example GitHub App that automates the protection of the master branch upon creation of new repositories within a GitHub organization. The creator of the new repository will be notified with an [@mention](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) in an issue within the repository that outlines the protections that were added.

This project listens for [organization events](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events) and uses the [Octokit.rb](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) library to make REST API calls.

## Prerequisites

To run this web service on your local machine, you will need to use a tool like Smee to send webhooks to your local machine without exposing it to the internet. If you're already comfortable with similar tools such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/), feel free to use those instead.

### Start a new Smee channel

Go to https://smee.io and click **Start a new channel**.

Starting a new Smee channel creates a unique domain where GitHub can send webhook payloads. This domain is called a Webhook Proxy URL and looks something like this: `https://smee.io/qrfeVRbFbffd6vD`

**Note:** The following steps are slightly different than the "Use the CLI" instructions you'll see on your Smee channel page. You do **not** need to follow the "Use the Node.js client" or "Using Probot's built-in support" instructions.

1. Install the Smee client
    ```
    npm install --global smee-client
    ```
    
1. Run the client (replacing `https://smee.io/qrfeVRbFbffd6vD` with your own domain):
    ```
    smee --url https://smee.io/qrfeVRbFbffd6vD --path /event_handler --port 3000
    ```
    
    You should see output like the following:
    ```
    Forwarding https://smee.io/qrfeVRbFbffd6vD to http://127.0.0.1:3000/event_handler
    Connected https://smee.io/qrfeVRbFbffd6vD
    ```

### Register a new GitHub App
Next, you will need to register a new GitHub App and install it in your GitHub organization.

1. Visit the settings page in your GitHub organization's profile, and click on GitHub Apps under Developer settings.
1. Click **New GitHub App**. You'll see a form where you can enter details about your app.
1. Give your app a name. This can be anything you'd like.
1. For the "Homepage URL", use the domain issued by Smee. For example: `https://smee.io/qrfeVRbFbffd6vD`
1. For the "Webhook URL", again use the domain issued by Smee.
1. For the "Webhook secret", create a password to secure your webhook endpoints. 
    
    You can use the following command to generate a random string with high entropy:
    ```
    ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'
    ```
    You'll need this secret again later, so make note of it somewhere before moving on.

1. Under Permissions, specify the following set of permissions for your app:
    * **Repository administration** (Read & Write)
    * **Issues** (Read & Write)

1. At the bottom of the page, specify whether this is a private app or a public app. For now, leave the app as private by selecting **Only on this account**.

1. Click **Create GitHub App** to create your app!

### Save your private key and App ID

After you create your app, you'll be taken back to the app settings page. You have two more things to do here:

1. **Generate a private key for your app**. This is necessary to authenticate your app later on. Scroll down on the page and click **Generate a private key**. Save the resulting PEM file in a directory where you can find it again.

1. **Note the app ID GitHub has assigned your app**. You'll need this later when you [set your environment variables](#Set-environment-variables).

### Install the app on your organization account

Now it's time to install the app. From your app's settings page, do the following:

1. Click **Install App** in the sidebar. Next to your organization name, click **Install**.

1. You'll be asked whether to install the app on all repositories or selected repositories. Select **All repositories**.

1. Click **Install**.


## Install

Run the following command to clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/parkerbxyz/master-branch-protector.git
```

Install dependencies by running the following command from the project directory:

```
gem install bundler && bundle install
```

With the dependencies installed, you can [start the server](#Start-the-server).

## Set environment variables

1. Create a copy of the `.env-example` file called `.env`.

    ```
    cp .env-example .env
    ```
    
1. Add your GitHub App's private key, app ID, and webhook secret to the `.env` file.
    
    **Note:** Copy the entire contents of your PEM file as the value of `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` in your `.env` file. 
    <br />
    Because the PEM file is more than one line you'll need to add quotes around the value like the example below:

    ```
    PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    HkVN9...
    ...
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
    GITHUB_APP_IDENTIFIER=12345
    GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
    ```

## Start the server

1. Run `ruby server.rb` on the command line. You should see a response like:

    ```
    == Sinatra (v2.0.3) has taken the stage on 3000 for development with backup from Puma
    Puma starting in single mode...
    * Version 3.11.2 (ruby 2.4.0-p0), codename: Love Song
    * Min threads: 0, max threads: 16
    * Environment: development
    * Listening on tcp://localhost:3000
    Use Ctrl-C to stop
    ```

1. View the Sinatra app at `localhost:3000` to verify your app is connected to the server.

The web service should now be running and watching for new repositories to be created within your organization! üöÄ

When you create a new repository in your organization, you should see some output in the Terminal tab where you started `server.rb` that looks something like this:

```
D, [2019-05-27T16:59:24.136072 #56585] DEBUG -- : ---- received event repository
D, [2019-05-27T16:59:24.136107 #56585] DEBUG -- : ----    action created
D, [2019-05-27T16:59:25.351392 #56585] DEBUG -- : Protecting master branch
D, [2019-05-27T16:59:25.739671 #56585] DEBUG -- : Creating a new issue
140.82.115.69 - - [27/May/2019:16:59:26 -0400] "POST /event_handler HTTP/1.1" 200 - 2.4251
127.0.0.1 - - [27/May/2019:16:59:24 EDT] "POST /event_handler HTTP/1.1" 200 0
- -> /event_handler
```

This means your app is running on the server as expected. üôå

If you don't see the output, make sure Smee is running correctly in another Terminal tab.

## Usage

You can add, remove, or modify the branch protection rules by changing the parameters inside the `options` array in the `protect_master_branch` helper method:
```ruby
# Protect the master branch on new repositories
    def protect_master_branch(payload)
      @repo = payload['repository']['full_name']
      @branch = payload['repository']['default_branch'] # master branch
      
      # This is where branch protection parameters go
      options = {
        # This header is necessary for beta access to the branch_protection API
        # See https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/branches/#update-branch-protection
        accept: 'application/vnd.github.luke-cage-preview+json',
        # Require at least two approving review on a pull request before merging
        required_pull_request_reviews: { required_approving_review_count: 2 },
        # Enforce all configured restrictions for administrators
        enforce_admins: true
      }
      
      logger.debug 'Protecting master branch'
      @installation_client.protect_branch(@repo, @branch, options)
    end
```

You can find a list of branch protection parameters in the [GitHub Developer Guide](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/branches/#update-branch-protection).

If you change any of the branch protection parameters in the `protect_master_branch` helper method, you should update the  `issue_body` variable in the `notify_user` helper method to reflect those changes:
```ruby
# Open an issue to notify the user of branch protection rules
    def notify_user(payload)
      username = payload['sender']['login']
      help_url = 'https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches'
      issue_title = 'Master Branch Protected üîê'
      
      # An outline of the protections that were added to the master branch
      issue_body = <<~BODY
        @#{username}: branch protection rules have been added to the `#{@branch}` branch.
        - Collaborators cannot force push to the protected branch or delete the branch
        - All commits must be made to a non-protected branch and submitted via a pull request
        - There must be least 2 approving reviews and no changes requested before a PR can be merged
        \n **Note:** All configured restrictions are enforced for administrators.
        \n You can learn more about protected branches here: [About protected branches - GitHub Help](#{help_url})
      BODY
      
      logger.debug 'Creating a new issue'
      @installation_client.create_issue(@repo, issue_title, issue_body)
    end
```
